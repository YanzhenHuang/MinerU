Dataset 
===========


Import Classes 
-----------------

Dataset 
^^^^^^^^

Each PDF or image will form one ``Dataset``. As we all know, PDF has two categories, :ref:`digital_method_section` or :ref:`ocr_method_section`.
Using images, you will get ``ImageDataset``, a sub-class of ``Dataset``. Using PDF files, you'll get ``PymuDocDataset``.
The difference between the two classes is that, the former only supports the ``OCR`` parse method, while the latter supports both ``OCR`` and ``TXT``.

.. note::

    In fact some PDFs may be generated by images, therefore it does not support being inferred using ``TXT`` methods. By far, user needs to ensure it does not happen.


Pdf Parse Methods
------------------

.. _ocr_method_section:
OCR 
^^^^
Extract chars via ``Optical Character Recognition`` technical.

.. _digital_method_section:
TXT
^^^^^^^^
Extract chars via third-party library, currently we use ``pymupdf``.
